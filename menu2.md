## Discriminatory Behaviour

Studies show that discrimination against African American and Latino burroughs is a large problem.

Reveal News published an article concerning discrimination in lending in <"https://www.revealnews.org/article/for-people-of-color-banks-are-shutting-the-door-to-homeownership"> . This article cites a study showing lending discrimination even when controlling for the usual factors such as income, credit history, etc. Banks achieve this primarily through geographic discrimination.

Although the data presented to Lending Club borrowers does not include any racially identifiable data, it does contain information that is molded by the borrower&#39;s race. For example, people in one area may be far more likely to be white than in another area that is more diverse. Thus, looking at the state or zip code could give investors a preliminary indication of the likelihood that the borrower is white.

The Reveal News article goes on to explain that lenders often cite confidential factors that make up a person&#39;s credit profile. Lenders say that minority borrowers tend to have lower credit profiles and thus are less likely to get loans.  However, these credit profile factors (such as credit score, salary, payment history) are themselves influence by a person&#39;s race. Thus, even if only indirectly, race plays a role in lending.

In our project, we attempted to collect demographic information by state and zip code but were unable to analyze how our models discriminated against minorities. If we had more time, the results of our model would have been compared with the information presented to see if the models picked more loans in white-majority areas. However, this would not have proven any real discrimination, but would be suggestive of more investigation.

Another possible area of concern is self-discrimination, where potential minority candidates simply do not apply for loans out of concerns that they will be denied. Or for example, perhaps Lending Club does not market to minorities and thus they may not know that they could apply. In either case, without having information about the borrower&#39;s race, it&#39;s impossible to determine this. However, perhaps some surveys of past borrowers might yield some helpful information. It would be interesting to know the racial makeup of borrowers.

It is worth noting the recent and ongoing litigation cases against Lending Club which, in our view, raise concerns about whether this company is improving the fairness of lending.  In Q1 2018 Lending Club settled a class action suit that had been brought against them by their own shareholders.  They settled for a total of 125M$.  Of this total, 77.3M$ is to be paid directly by the company and the remainder will be covered by insurance. The basis of the lawsuit was that Lending Club had, falsified the data related to certain loans and that this had inflated the value of the stock price.

There is another current class action lawsuit against Lending Club from borrowers who are claiming that LendingClub essentially extracted far more in fees than had been agreed.  Certainly, the fact that fees paid by borrowers are about 4 times the fees paid by investors is not well disclosed on their website.
