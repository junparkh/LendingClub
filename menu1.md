**Description of Data:**

We downloaded the raw data from the Lending Club website. The data was structured as a large.csv.  Data was provided related to the unfunded and the funded loans. Unfortunately there was very little data provided related to the actual demographics of the borrowers.  This made performing any analyses related to either discrimination or preferential treatment impossible.

**Overview of the raw data** : There were 1,873,290 records in the data file covering a span of almost 11 years of data.  The funded data relates to loans which have been approved by the LendingClub and then funded by investors.  The unfunded data (&#39;rejected&#39;) relates to borrowing applications which had been approved by LendingClub and assigned a credit rating but not funded by investors.  The critical part of our modeling would focus on whether loan applications which were funded were actually repaid and, if they were repaid, the overall level of interest earned on these loans.  Unfortunately, the unfunded data was of little help in determining profitability as there is then no record of whether these loan applicants would or would not have repaid their loans.

[If we had been able to pursue the discrimination issue further then the unfunded data would have been a potentially interesting source of information.  We believe that the most likely point where discrimination might take place would be at the point between &quot;approved by LendingClub&quot; and &quot;funded by investors&quot;.   That said, given LendingClub&#39;s poor track record with respect to data transparency there would also have been opportunities for discrimination in the initial phase from applicant to approval by LendingClub. For more details on the ongoing litigation against Lending Club please see the section on discrimination.]

**Data Wrangling** : We concentrated the data wrangling activities within the file Data\_cleansing.ipynb.  The data wrangling can be broken down into give different parts:

1. Credit-worthiness;
2. Loan Dates;
3. Loans Profitability -\&gt; y;
4. Selecting the predictor sub-set; and
5. Saving the data as a condensed bz2 file

**(1) Credit-worthiness**: some of the key metrics needed to be adjusted to allow the dates to show up as parametric variables. These included:

- Zip code: We were provided with a three digit zip code which was all we had to go on from a demographic point of view. We created a function &quot;extract\_number&quot; which pulled the Zip Code from the data;
- Credit History: The time from the first credit line application until today represents the length of the applicant&#39;s presence within the credit scoring system. In general, longer credit histories are seen as better;
- Employment Length: Data needed to be cleansed to allow it to be continuous. Employment length is typically seen as one of the more important indicators of creditworthiness;
- Annual Income: Obviously an important credit score indicator. However, we would prefer that the applicant did not repay his or her loan early. We imputed the missing values for this predictor using the mean; and
- Credit Score: We turned the A1, B2 etc credit scores into a linear/ordinal predicator and assigned it a score from 0.0 (A1 - the best) to 6.8 (G5 - the worst). We created a function &quot;subgrade\_score&quot; which performed this parametrization of the credit score variable.

**(2) Loan Dates**: there were a number of issues around the loan dates. In particular, we needed to understand which loans were actually completed and which were still running. We decided to exclude the still running loans from our model. A couple of the key parameters are worth discussing:

- Last\_pymnt\_date: this refers strictly the last payment made rather than the date that the last payment of the loan is due. To be clear, if a loan was made in Month=1 and had a term of 36 months then the final loan payment would be due in Month=36. If we were actually in Month 10 and the most recent payment had been made then the parameter last\_pymnt\_date would record 10 not 36;
- Issue date: refers to the start date of the loan. When the money was drawn;
- Term\_months: refers to the length of the loan assuming that all payments are successfully made;

**(3) Loan Profitability**: this was by far the most difficult metric to analyse. There is a saying in the finance community that, &quot;you cannot eat APR&quot;.  This refers to the fact that if the APR (Annual Percentage Rate) charge on a loan is very high but does not last very long then you can have exceptionally large APR but no nominal return. An example serves to illustrate this point well:

Loan 1 = 100$; Term = 1 month; APR = 313%.

Loan 2 = 100$; Term = 12 months; APR = 20%.

The total cash generated by the first loan over the life of the loan is 10$. The APR is high because this 10$ was generated over a short period of time (1.1^12 =313%). On the other hand, the cash generated by the second loan is 20$ or twice as much. The total amount earned over the two loans was 30$ or an APR of 15%.

Taking averages of APRs is therefore quite tricky. To facilitate our investment strategy and modeling over such a large database we decided to exclude loans with a length less than 60 days. This is reasonable because from an operational point of view we would prefer to have longer loans – our targets are 3 or 5 year loans.  Also, we excluded APRs\&gt;100%. These occur either due to penalties or due to very short loan periods and these are not our target investments.

Completed Loans: we assigned &quot;good&quot; to those loans which were fully paid-off.

**(4) Subset Public Data**:   Primarily due to lack of data we reduced the predictors from the original data to the following:

- loan\_amnt
- term\_months
- int\_rate
- credit\_score
- emp\_length\_years
- home\_ownership
- annual\_inc
- verification\_status
- dti:  debt to interest following the LendingClub loan
- deling\_2yrs: whether the applicant had a delinquent payment in the last 2 years
- credit\_history\_years
- ing\_last\_6mths: whether there has been a credit inquiry in the past 6 months
- mths\_since\_last\_deling: months since the last delinquent payment
- mths\_since\_last\_record: months since the last public record of credit history
- pen\_acc: the number of open credit accounts in the borrower&#39;s credit file
- pub\_rec: Number of derogatory public records
- revol\_bal: total credit – revolving balance (outstanding debt)
- revol\_util\_perc: percentage of the revolving facility utilized e.g. a credit card line
- total\_acc: the total number of credit lines in the borrower&#39;s account

**(5) Save Subset**: we then used this selected subset of parameters to create a new loan file and &quot;pickled&quot; it as analysis-predictors.bz2. The target data set (y) was saved as analysis-target.bz2).

We hoped that this reduced parametric subset would allow us to run quicker models.

**Business Model Update**** :**

Following a in depth review of the LendingClub (LC) website as well as an analysis of their past two 10K submissions which are available on the SEC&#39;s Edgar portal (see references) our understanding of the overall business model has evolved considerable.

It makes sense to discuss the mechanics of how the actual business works so that we have both the nomenclature and mechanics clear.

The overall LC business model works as follows:

|   | Example | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  (a)Fees paid by Borrower to LC |   | Not yet clear how these fees are structured but they are 4x as large as the LC Investor fee. Source:10K  |
|   (b)Gross interest paid by Borrowed | 15%   | Assume a 10,000 loan this would be 15% per annum. This is a function of the credit risk of the borrower and determined by LC. Higher credit risk means higher gross interest.  |
|  (c)Fees paid by Investor to LC | 1% | Paid on any payments (interest or principal) made by the borrower.   |
|  (d)Net Credit Costs | 9% | High due to the unsecured nature of the credit. Very difficult to collect against defaulters.  |
|  (e)Net Investor returns  | 5% | (b) – (c) – (d) = (e) |

**Comments** :

**(a):  Fees paid by Borrows to LC**: Most of LCs revenues come from fees paid by the borrower to LC rather than from the fees paid by investors.  Q4 2017 revenues were 121M$ from transaction and 24M$ from investor fees. LC also collects additional fees during any work-out loan cases, however, the total value of these fees was 1.4M$ for the same quarter so less than 2% of revenues.

**(b) &amp; (d) Gross interest paid by the borrower and Net Credit Costs**: **Prior** to being offered to investors individual loan applications are screened and given a credit score.  Some loans are rejected by LC outright and not offered to investors.  Of those loans offered to investors, the gross interest rate charged is set based on the creditworthiness of the borrower. LC, therefore, has already used an algorithm to assign gross interest charges to a borrower before these loans are seen by investors. &quot;Is this algorithm accurate?&quot;, will be a key aspect of our model.

How much should additional interest be a charge to compensate for reduced credit-worthiness?  An example is useful at this point to illustrate the fat-tailed nature of the loss distribution function often found in finance.  (See references – Nassim Taleb).

**Example:**

- 3-year loan;
- 36 equal payments of interest and principal
- Final payment = 1/36 of the total loan
- &quot;Excellent Credit&quot; has 100% chance of repaying the loan
- &quot;Poor Credit&quot; defaults 50% of the time after making 18 months of payment. No loan recover is made

|   | **Excellent Credit** | **Poor Credit** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (e) Desired return | 5% | 5% |
| (d) Net Credit Costs (\*) | 0% | 25% |
| (c) Investor fee to LC | 1% | 1% |
| (b) Gross Interest Rate Required | 6% | 31% |

To earn the same investment return from the poor credit as from the excellent credit the gross interest charged would need to be 31% vs 6% respectively.  This is driven by the fact that 50% of the time there is a 50% loss of principal for the poor credit risks. Therefore, over the course of 54 payments (36 payments 50% of the time, and 18 payments 50% of the time until default) sufficient additional income needs to be generated to cover the 5000$ principal loss that occurs 50% of the time.

(c) Fee paid by Investor to LC. This fee is not affected by credit worthiness as it is only collected in the event a payment is made

(e) Each investor has their own targeted returns, however, for simplicity, we have used the examples given on the Investor video provided by LC = 5%.

**Summary of Findings – Caps, and Floors** : Each loan tranche that the investor funds have an implicit capped return, i.e. the borrower agrees to the loan with a fixed interest rate which cannot be increased over the life of the loan. This is the maximum return that the investor can make and therefore represents the cap. On the other hand, because it is an unsecured loan the potential loss for the investor is 100%.

**Implications of the Business Model findings on the EDA and predictive modeling:** the main driver to the future returns by investors are determined by limiting credit losses. The overall distributions of credit losses has a fat, left-tail distribution.  The maximum return is capped when the loan is made but the actual return can be -100%.  In addition, due to the nature of the credit market, instead of paying 25 % and then default, it makes more sense for the borrowers to default on the whole amount, which explains the shape of the fat tail.

**Anti-Discriminatory Behavior:** In addition to the above we note that LC paid a class action settlement lawsuit of 77.3M$ in Q4 2017. This represented 50% of revenue for that quarter. We have not yet been able to get sufficient details regarding this lawsuit to understand whether it is related to discriminatory practices.  Our investigation is ongoing.

Another anti-discrimination investigation is related to the zip code. We want to check the whether the percentage of the loan lending has the location bias (rich neighborhood verses some area which was weakened by the Economic Depression )
