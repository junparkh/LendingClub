    "Monte Carlo reinforcement learning required that the returns for an entire episode be computed before any values are available for use. The disadvantage of that approach is the full set of returns are required for state value or action value estimates. \n",

    "## On Policy(SARSA) vs. Off Policy(Q-learning) Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will explore examples of two broad categories of RL algorithms known as **on policy** and **off policy** methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "On policy methods evaluate and improve a single policy. On policy methods converge quickly and often to good solution. In general, **exploration** is performed using $\\epsilon$-greedy methods. The TD(0) and MC algorithms we have examined are examples of on policy methods. On policy algorithms are known to have good convergence properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, off policy methods use two policies. The policy the agent is following is called the **behavior policy**, denoted $b(A_t | S_t)$. The policy being improved is known as the **target policy**, denoted $\\pi (A_t | S_t)$. The agent obtains samples of the environment while following the behavior policy. These samples are used to improve the target policy. An advantage of off policy methods is that a deterministic behavior policy can be used while a better target policy is developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Q-learning has the following advantages and disadvantages compared to SARSA:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q-learning directly learns the optimal policy, whilst SARSA learns a near-optimal policy whilst exploring. If we want to learn an optimal policy using SARSA, then we will need to decide on a strategy to decay ϵ in ϵ-greedy action choice, which may become a fiddly hyperparameter to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q-learning (and off-policy learning in general) has higher per-sample variance than SARSA, and may suffer from problems converging as a result. This turns up as a problem when training neural networks via Q-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- SARSA will approach convergence allowing for possible penalties from exploratory moves, whilst Q-learning will ignore them. That makes SARSA more conservative - if there is risk of a large negative reward close to the optimal path, Q-learning will tend to trigger that reward whilst exploring, whilst SARSA will tend to avoid a dangerous optimal path and only slowly learn to use it when the exploration parameters are reduced. The classic toy problem that demonstrates this effect is called **[cliff walking.](https://github.com/cvhu/CliffWalking)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the critical point in practice is that the last point can make a big difference if mistakes are costly - e.g. when we are training a robot not in simulation, but in the real world. we may prefer a more conservative learning algorithm that avoids high risk, if there was real time and money at stake if the robot was damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our goal is to train an optimal agent in simulation, or in a low-cost and fast-iterating environment, then Q-learning is a good choice, due to the first point (learning optimal policy directly). If our agent learns online, and we care about rewards gained whilst learning, then SARSA may be a better choice."

    "The Q-learning algorithm just presented has a significant **bias**. To understand why this might be consider the following thought experiment. In most cases the sampled action values are inaccurate. Some action values will have a positive error and some will have a negative error. In the error is on the order of the values themselves, the $max_a$ operator has a reasonable chance of selecting an action value that is the largest because of this error. However, the $max_a$ operator will never select an action with a low value simply because of the errors. The net result is a bias toward action values with the largest positive error. \n",
    "\n",
    "What can be done to correct this situation? One relatively simple and effective algorithm is known as **double Q-learning**. Double Q-learning maintains two tables of action values. The values from one table are used to perform the bootstrap updates of the other table and vice versa. This approach averages out the bias. For two tables, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ we can express double Q-learning as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q_1(S_t,A_t) = Q_1(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\big[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_2(S_{t+1},argmax_a Q_1(S_{t+1}, a) - Q_1(S_t,A_t) \\big] \\\\\n",
