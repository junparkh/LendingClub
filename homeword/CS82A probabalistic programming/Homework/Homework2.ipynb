In this exercise you will construct a Directed Bayesian Graphical Model or belief network for the available evidence. \n",

Given that there is no evidence of a break in, she realizes that if a third person was involved they must have had assistance from either the cook, the butler or both. In other words, the cook and the butler may be guilty even if they did not commit the actual killing with the knife. \n",
