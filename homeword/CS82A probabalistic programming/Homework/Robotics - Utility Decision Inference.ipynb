    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Robotics are becoming common place in many business situations. For example in retail sales robotics are used in warehouse management. Amazon is widely known to be a leader in this area. But, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, UK online grocery retailer, Ocado, is rumored to have even more sophisticated order fulfilment robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-robots-and-drones-will-change-retail-forever-1539604800   \n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, companies like Amazon and Ocado do not disclose much information on their robotics. Nonetheless, we can be sure that sensor fusion is a significant problem. For example, sensor fusion is a significant issue with self driving cars. See for example:\n",

    "Bob's Orchards is a premium seller of apples and pears. Bob's customers pay a substantial premium for superior fruit. To satisfy these customers, Bob's must ensure that the fruit delivered is correctly packed and perfectly ripe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many legacy industries requiring specialized human skills, Bob's is facing a talent problem. Many of the human inspectors who expertly check each piece of fruit shipped for ripeness are approaching retirement age. Management's attempts to recruit younger people to apprentice as fruit inspectors have been, well, fruitless (oh, sorry!:). Therefore, it has become imperative to find some type of automated system which can reduce the workload on the diminishing number of human inspectors. To address this problem, Bob's is deploying technology from Robots R Us.\n"

    "## Scenario  : Robot Inspector\n",
    "\n",
    "The first robotic system to be deployed at Bob's uses a multi-sensor array to determine if the fruit being shipped is at the correct ripeness. There are two sensors, a vision system that examines the fruit for spots, indicating the fruit is over ripe, and a smell sensor that determines if the fruit is not ripe enough. If either sensor indicates the fruit is bad it is sent to a human inspector. In addition customers may reject even perfect fruit for no apparent reason, whereas others seem perfectly happy with less than perfect fruit.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distributions, decisions and utilities of this system can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "1. The unconditional probability distribution of the ripeness of the fruit being packed is known\n",
    "2. The probability that each sensor reads correctly or not is known experimentally. A table must be constructed that gives computes the conditional probability of accepting or rejecting fruit given the actual ripeness. More on this latter.\n",
    "3. The decision is then made to have a human inspector examine the fruit or not. \n",
    "4. The utility of the human inspection of the fruit. \n",
    "4. The conditional probability of a customer accepting or not good depending on if the order is good or bad. \n",
    "5. The utility of the customer accepting or rejecting an order.  "

    "## Basics of Utility Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "To make optimal decisions an intelligent agent must have a way to measure the value of the outcomes. Creating functions to measure the value of outcomes is the domain of **utility theory**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example. Let's say that you go to a charity dinner and you buy a raffle ticket to win a prize worth \\$1,000. There are 100 tickets and each ticket costs $100. Your joy of supporting this important charity is worth 200 to you. What is your utility of buying one ticket:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(1) = -p(buy) * cost + p(feeling) * value + p(win) * 1000 \\\\\n",
    "= - 1.0 * 100 + 1.0 * 200 + 0.01 * 1000 \\\\\n",
    "= 110$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the foregoing example you can likely see that the general form of a utility function can be expressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(S) = \\sum_{s} p(s)\\ u(s)\\\\\n",
    "where\\\\\n",
    "p(s) = probability\\ of\\ state\\ s\\\\\n",
    "u(s) = utility\\ of\\ state\\ s $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with the example. There is no reason that a utility function should have linear scaling. To understand this consider what your utility will be if you buy two raffle tickets. Your cost is now $200 for the tickets, and you have doubled your chance of winning the prize. You might think that your utility might be only 20. But, perhaps not. Your joy at helping the charity might be 400 making your utility of your larger donation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(2) = - 1.0 * 2 * 100 + 1.0 * 400 + 0.01 * 2 * 1000 \\\\\n",
    "= 220$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above, you can see that **amount of money does not equal utility**. To understand this concept consider the following situation. In his youth, your instructor took many long backpacking trips. The person who organized the food for one 5-day hike did a poor job. Meals were minimal, and by the last day, there was no food left at all. We arrived in Aspen Colorado in mid afternoon quite hungry. We found a popular hamburger restaurant and spent the very last bit of money to buy a hamburger. The utility of that hamburger was much greater than the price paid. Then as now, Aspen is a playground of the wealthy. It is very likely that the utility of a hamburger to these wealthy customers was considerably less than too a young man who has not had enough to eat for several days!  "

    "## Actions and Expected Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "By itself, a utility function does not tell us anything about the results of **actions** the agent might take. The **expected utility function** is the product of the value of a state multiplied by the probability of being in a state given the observation and the action:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Influence Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the use of Bayesian networks as a representation of probability distribtuions and their independecies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A representation for a decision process must preserve **causality**. A decision cannot be made until previous decisions have been made and resulting state is observed. Bayesian networks represent causality or influence of one set of variables to others. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two additional elements that must be added to Bayesian networks to transform them to influence diagrams:\n",
    "1. Decision nodes which have no distribution. In effect, the decision nodes are like switches which initiate actions in the environment. We illustrate decisions nodes as rectangles. \n",
    "2. Utility nodes, which measures the value of the states of the environment. We illustrate utility nodes as diamonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also need three types of directed edges to specify influence diagrams. \n",
    "- Edges that **propagate belief**, or conditional information as we used before. \n",
    "- **Informational edges** which propagate information that is not related to a distribution or belief.\n",
    "- **Functional edges** which end in utility nodes which propagate the information needed for the utility calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a few simple cases that occur in influence diagrams. As illustrated in the diagram below a random variable in an influence diagram can be dependent on both other random variables as well as decisions. We have already spent considerable time on dependencies and independencies of random variables. But consider what happens when a decision is imposed. The decision will force the probabilities of some states to 0. That is, a decision allows some states but not others to occur. \n",

    "<center> **Dependent random variable with decision** </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram notice that the edge between the decision and the random variable is shown as an **information link**. This is because, decisions have no distributions associated with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below shows how a utility node can be dependent on both random variables and decision nodes. We have already discussed how a probability distribution is used to compute utility. A decision will fix the set of states which are possible and therefore the total utility. \n",

    "## Consistency and Partial Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "As has already been mentioned causality is important in influence diagrams. This property is know as **causal consistency**. Influence in must be in causal order. This organization is called **partial ordering**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have a series of variables, $\\chi_i$, separated by decision variables, $D_i$. The variable $\\chi_i$ must be observed before the decision $D_i$ can be made. The variable $\\chi_{i+1}$ cannot be observed before decision $D_i$ is made. We represent the partial ordering with the precedence symbol, $\\prec$. We represent this situation as:\n",

    "## Inference on Influence Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, we explored a number of widely used exact inference methods for Bayesian belief networks. It turns out that many of the inference methods for Bayesian networks, like variable elimination, belief propagation, and the junction tree algorithm, can be applied to the case of influence diagrams as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will only touch on the variable elimination method. Variable elimination for influence diagrams follows a similar process as for Bayesian networks. The difference being that we proceed in the reverse of the partial ordering.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the partial ordering of a set of random variables $x_t$ and decision variables $d_t$ we can write the probability of the $T$th state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_{1:T}, d_{1:T}) = \\prod_{t = 1}^T p(x_t\\ |\\ x_{t-1}, d_{1:t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying through by the utility, $u(x_{1:T}, d_{1:T})$ we can maximize the sums over the variables for each of the decisions:  \n",

    "\n",
    "There is one factorization we can apply to variable elimination on influence diagrams to simplify the problem. We can take advantage of the fact that early decisions are **independent** of latter decisions since the later decisions are not yet known. Thus, in many cases we can simply sum the marginal utilities."
